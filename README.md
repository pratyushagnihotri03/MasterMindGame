#Microsoft .Net Gadgeteer based Mastermind game
Microsoft .Net Gadgeteer is an open source toolkit for creating fun apps with a solderless effort. We designed a Mastermind game for two modes, single player and double player, using different modules of Gadgeteer. This small project enabled us, to design and code in C# and understand .Net Gadgeteer libraries and use them.
